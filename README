groff-cmu
=========

This repository contains files for the Computer Modern Serif font for groff,
and allows for generating PDFs with this font. It might work with PostScript
too, I haven't tested though.

Quick usage (tested with 'ms' macros):
* Clone this repo

* Add the line `.ds FAM CMUSerif` before the text you want in this font in your
  document.

* Compile the groff document and output to a PDF, after specifying the font
  path, like so:
  GROFF_FONT_PATH="/path/to/cloned/repo" groff -k file.ms -ms -Tpdf > out.pdf

Notes:
This only contains the *Serif* font family for now (incl. Roman, Bold, Italic,
and BoldItalic) as it's the only family I cared about adding. I will happily
accept any PRs which add the other font families!
